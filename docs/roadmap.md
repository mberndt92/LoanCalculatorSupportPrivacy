Thank you for downloading Loans - Loan Calculator app!
This is actually the very first app I created and I am very proud of myself for it and thanks to you I might be able to keep developing it.

### Premium Features Disclaimer
Loan is and will always be free, without any advertisement.

I do however plan on adding some **premium** features if the app is being used enough.
**Why?** I do want to keep providing new functionality to my users and enhance the app. To be able to support myself and my family however I cannot exclusively provide all my work and services for free.
I do however promise to listen to & give back to my users based off of the success of the app.
This does not only apply to this app but also to any future apps I might develop.

## Roadmap
This section is a work in progress, however I do plan on looking into the following aspects, mostly becoming part of a premium feature bundle.

### Available to all users

[] More configuration options for the loan calculation (e.g. payments interval)
[] Rate app popup (I'll not add this unless I find a good, non-intrusive spot for it)
[] Support for more languages
[] Contact developer straight from the app (for bugs, feedback, requests)

### Part of Premium Bundle

[] Add an entirely new financial overview page for statistics across all loans
[] Add more statistics in the form of charts & graphs (both for an individual loan as well as an entirely new financial overview sections)
[] Add the ability to add extra payments to the loan (first manually but later automatically e.g. yearly basis)
[] Add a widget to quickly check a loans status right on the home screen (& trigger extra payments from there e.g.)
[] Add optional notifications as reminders for monthly payments
