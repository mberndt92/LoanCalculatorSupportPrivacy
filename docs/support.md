### How do I calculate my loan ?
The calculation of the loan is based off of various input factors such as the loan total amount, the yearly interest rate as well as the duration of the loan.
Using compound interest the calculation leads to an estimated monthly payment.

### What is an amortization schedule ?
An amortization schedule shows the depriciation of the loan over time.
In the beginning it will be the full loan amount but, latest, after the full duration of the loan the balance, meaning the amount that is owed, reaches 0.
For every payment made it shows the share of the principal and interest paid.

### What is "Principal" ?
Principal refers to the amount that is actually deducted from the remaining owed loan amount. Let's look at an example. Assume I take out a loan for 1000$. I make a payment on day X of 200$ which might break down as 150$ principal and 50$ interest. This means after this payment the remaining loan balance is 850$, 1000$ - 150$.
